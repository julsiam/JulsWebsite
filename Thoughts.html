                                    1.
                                    In this exhausting world, you will always have your family to lift you up, to
                                    fill
                                    your present with hope, to provide your soul with motivation and to support your
                                    heart with unending and unconditional love. We can go wherever we want, we may
                                    settle in different directions but we will always go back to the roots where we
                                    started, FAMILY! <br> <br> 2. In this world, no one stays by your side forever.
                                    It’s
                                    tough but it is what it is. So you have to learn doing things alone. Never depend
                                    on
                                    others. BE INDEPENDENT! <br> <br> 3. In this changing world, remember that it’s not
                                    you
                                    versus the other people. It should be you versus the person you were yesterday.
                                    Don’t spend your energy trying to compete with others. You are crossing different
                                    paths and you shouldn’t depend yours on them. MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS! <br> <br> 4.
                                    In
                                    this world where imperfection is a big deal, remember to let go of the idea on
                                    impressing others. Never beg for attention and never fit in just to be accepted. As
                                    long as you know who you are and what makes you happy, it doesn’t matter how others
                                    will see you. You are unique on your own different way. <br> <br> 5. In this world
                                    where
                                    nothing is constant but change, you should learn to appreciate what you have,
                                    before
                                    time pushes you to appreciate what you had. Spend your time wisely with the people
                                    you love. You don’t know, your time with them is already limited. BE APPRECIATIVE!
                                    <br> <br> 6. In this world where challenges and sufferings exist, remember to
                                    always
                                    look
                                    for the brighter side. “Everything happens for a reason”. At the right time, your
                                    heartbreaks will turn into breakthroughs. Always be positive. CLAIM IT! <br><br>8.
                                    Accept! Move on! Let go! Let God!...Life goes on!

                                <p> I was walking home when someone called my name. As I turned back, I saw how
                                    terrified he was. He was anxious and disturbed. I asked him what's the matter and
                                    what he told me were enough to stop my senses. After hearing those words, I felt a
                                    bang in my chest. A fire started to burn inside me that drove to the arise of
                                    different emotions. There was a moment of deafening silence and I couldn't move. My
                                    world just ubruptly stopped for an instance. My mind wasn't able to process
                                    anything. After a while, I found myself running as fast as I could after the moment
                                    of surprise. I was chasing my breath. I didn't know what to do. I was like a poor
                                    rat chased by a lion.
                                    When I arrived home, I could sense the mourning of everyone. It felt like a storm
                                    just passed by, wiping everything in its way. Something unexplainable happened. I
                                    felt suffocated, still chasing my breath. My feet didn't want to take a step.
                                    Different emotions came in and I couldn't help it. But there's no turning back. I
                                    was there already, so I continued.
                                    Although I was in a complete chaos, I managed to enter the room. From there, I
                                    couldn't stop my tears from bursting as I saw the woman on the corner lying on a
                                    rough wooden bed. There's this unfathomable expression on her face and the coldness
                                    enwrapped her being. I gave her a tight grip and from that moment, I realized
                                    something. I just lost the most important person in the world. She's my mother
                                    lying
                                    in bed, lifeless.
                                    After what happened, it felt like a catastrophe. Indeed, nothing in this world is
                                    constant but change. Life must go on, besides, that's the reality. As you grow
                                    older, you will lose people in your journey but what's more important is that you
                                    had created memories with them. Memories that will forever be cherished.</p>

                                <p>You know, sometimes we are in a situation where expectations from our loved ones are
                                    way too high to meet and too many to take. Actually I think it's the nature for us
                                    people. But lemme me ask you this, is it only the expectations of people around you
                                    thats making your life way complicated? Or is it also YOUR EXPECTATIONS FOR
                                    YOURSELF? Come to think of it. Don't you set standards and expectations for your
                                    own
                                    self to reach as well? Sometimes we tend to assume that people's expectations from
                                    us are the hindrances that prevented is from our freedom, that limiting us from
                                    what
                                    we can do, stopping us to expand our horizon and going out from our own shells but
                                    have you noticed your expectations for yourself? Not just because there are people
                                    expecting it from you that's why you worked hard for it but because of your own
                                    standard as well. Did you get my point? Worse is, when you grew up dominating among
                                    others, like in everything, in class, in the workplace or wherever, you always got
                                    on top, along with the praises, honors, and awards, expectations from people around
                                    you and for yourself will also exist. And as time goes by, it will gradually occupy
                                    your thoughts. And by that instance, you develop a sense of fear on disappointing
                                    yourself and people around you. You are not alone.</p>
